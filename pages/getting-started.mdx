# Getting Started

## Trying out Authorizer

This guide helps you trying out Authorizer and evaluate it. It includes instructions for installing the Authorizer server in standalone mode.

## Get Authorizer Instance

Deploy production ready Authorizer instance using one click deployment options available below

| **Infra provider** |                                                                                           **One-click link**                                                                                            |               **Additional information**               |

## Deploy Authorizer Using Source Code

This guide helps you practice using Authorizer to evaluate it before you use it in a production environment. It includes instructions for installing the Authorizer server in local or standalone mode.

#### Install using source code

#### Prerequisites

- OS: Linux or macOS or windows
- Go: [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/) >= v1.15

#### Project Setup

1. Fork the [authorizer](https://github.com/authorizerdev/authorizer) repository (**Skip this step if you have access to repo**)
2. Clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/authorizerdev/authorizer.git` or use the forked url from step 1
3. Change directory to authorizer: `cd authorizer`
4. Create Env file `cp .env.sample .env`. Check all the supported env [here](https://docs.authorizer.dev/core/env/)
5. Build Dashboard `make build-dashboard`
6. Build App `make build-app`
7. Build Server `make clean && make`
   > Note: if you don't have [`make`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.2?topic=concepts-make-command), you can `cd` into `server` dir and build using the `go build` command. In that case you will have to build `dashboard` & `app` manually using `npm run build` on both dirs.
8. Run binary `./build/server`

## Deploy Authorizer using binaries

Deploy / Try Authorizer using binaries. With each [Authorizer Release](https://github.com/authorizerdev/authorizer/releases)
binaries are baked with required deployment files and bundled. You can download a specific version of it for the following operating systems:

- Mac OSX
- Linux

#### Download and unzip bundle

- Download the Bundle for the specific OS from the [release page](https://github.com/authorizerdev/authorizer/releases)

> Note: For windows, we recommend running using docker image to run authorizer.

- Unzip using following command

  - Mac / Linux

  ```sh
  tar -zxf AUTHORIZER_VERSION -c authorizer
  ```

- Change directory to `authorizer`

  ```sh
  cd authorizer
  ```

#### Step 3: Start Authorizer

- Run following command to start authorizer

  - For Mac / Linux users

  ```sh
  ./build/server
  ```

> Note: For mac users, you might have to give binary the permission to execute. Here is the command you can use to grant permission `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine build/server`



## Setup Instance

- Open authorizer instance endpoint in browser
- Sign up as an admin with a secure password
- Configure environment variables from authorizer dashboard. Check env [docs](/core/env) for more information

> Note: `DATABASE_URL`, `DATABASE_TYPE` and `DATABASE_NAME` are only configurable via platform envs

### Things to consider

- For social logins, you will need respective social platform key and secret
- For having verified users, you will need an SMTP server with an email address and password using which system can send emails. The system will send a verification link to an email address. Once an email is verified then, only able to access it.
  > Note: One can always disable the email verification to allow open sign up, which is not recommended for production as anyone can use anyone's email address 😅
- For persisting user sessions, you will need Redis URL (not in case of railway app). If you do not configure a Redis server, sessions will be persisted until the instance is up or not restarted. For better response time on authorization requests/middleware, we recommend deploying Redis on the same infra/network as your authorizer server.
- The authorizer dashboard only works when accessing from a domain with HTTPS, because else https cookies wont be set and it will not work.

## Integrating into your website

This example demonstrates how you can use [`@authorizerdev/authorizer-js`](/authorizer-js/getting-started) CDN version and have login ready for your site in few seconds. You can also use the ES module version of [`@authorizerdev/authorizer-js`](/authorizer-js/getting-started) or framework-specific versions like [`@authorizerdev/authorizer-react`](/authorizer-react/getting-started)

### Copy the following code in `html` file

> **Note:** Change AUTHORIZER_URL in the below code with your authorizer URL. Also, you can change the logout button component

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@authorizerdev/authorizer-js/lib/authorizer.min.js"></script>

<script type="text/javascript">
  const authorizerRef = new authorizerdev.Authorizer({
    authorizerURL: `YOUR_AUTHORIZER_INSTANCE_URL`,
    redirectURL: window.location.origin,
    clientID: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID', // obtain your client id from authorizer dashboard
  })

  // use the button selector as per your application
  const logoutBtn = document.getElementById('logout')
  logoutBtn.addEventListener('click', async function () {
    await authorizerRef.logout()
    window.location.href = '/'
  })

  async function onLoad() {
    const res = await authorizerRef.authorize({
      response_type: 'code',
      use_refresh_token: false,
    })
    if (res && res.access_token) {
      // you can use user information here, eg:
      const user = await authorizerRef.getProfile({
        Authorization: `Bearer ${res.access_token}`,
      })
      const userSection = document.getElementById('user')
      const logoutSection = document.getElementById('logout-section')
      logoutSection.classList.toggle('hide')
      userSection.innerHTML = `Welcome, ${user.email}`
    }
  }
  onLoad()
</script>
```
